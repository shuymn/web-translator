# Requirements for Cloudflare to Vercel Migration

## Overview
Migrate the web-translator application from Cloudflare Workers to Vercel to resolve OpenAI API region blocking issues and establish a maintainable deployment environment.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Platform Migration
- **FR1.1**: The application must run on Vercel's platform with a fixed region deployment
- **FR1.2**: The deployment region must be configurable and restricted to OpenAI-supported regions
- **FR1.3**: The application must maintain all existing translation functionality

### 2. Storage Migration
- **FR2.1**: Replace Cloudflare KV with Redis for translation caching
- **FR2.2**: Maintain the same cache key generation logic (SHA-256 hashing)
- **FR2.3**: Support TTL-based cache expiration (7 days as per current implementation)
- **FR2.4**: Ensure Redis connection is properly managed and errors are handled gracefully

### 3. AI Integration
- **FR3.1**: Maintain OpenAI GPT-4-mini integration for translations
- **FR3.2**: Support streaming responses using Vercel AI SDK
- **FR3.3**: Remove dependency on Cloudflare AI Gateway (use direct OpenAI API)

### 4. Routing and SSR
- **FR4.1**: Maintain React Router v7 SSR functionality
- **FR4.2**: Support the existing route structure (`/` and `/api/completion`)
- **FR4.3**: Ensure proper environment variable access in route handlers

## Non-Functional Requirements

### 1. Performance
- **NFR1.1**: Translation response time should not degrade compared to Cloudflare Workers
- **NFR1.2**: Cold start times should be minimized (target: <500ms)
- **NFR1.3**: Redis operations should have sub-100ms latency

### 2. Security
- **NFR2.1**: All sensitive credentials (OpenAI API key, Redis URL) must be stored as environment variables
- **NFR2.2**: Redis connection must use TLS/SSL
- **NFR2.3**: No hardcoded values or secrets in the codebase

### 3. Reliability
- **NFR3.1**: Application should handle Redis connection failures gracefully (fallback to direct API calls)
- **NFR3.2**: Proper error messages for users when services are unavailable
- **NFR3.3**: Logging for debugging production issues

### 4. Development Experience
- **NFR4.1**: Local development environment must work without Redis (using in-memory cache)
- **NFR4.2**: Clear documentation for environment setup
- **NFR4.3**: Automated deployment via Vercel CLI or GitHub integration

## Testing Requirements

### 1. Unit Tests
- **TR1.1**: Test cache key generation remains consistent
- **TR1.2**: Test Redis storage operations (get, set with TTL)
- **TR1.3**: Test error handling for Redis failures

### 2. Integration Tests
- **TR2.1**: Test translation API endpoint with Redis caching
- **TR2.2**: Test streaming response functionality
- **TR2.3**: Test fallback behavior when Redis is unavailable

### 3. Migration Tests
- **TR3.1**: Verify all Cloudflare-specific code is removed
- **TR3.2**: Ensure no references to Cloudflare KV remain
- **TR3.3**: Validate environment variable configuration

## Configuration Requirements

### 1. Vercel Configuration
- **CR1.1**: Create `vercel.json` with region pinning configuration
- **CR1.2**: Configure build and deployment settings
- **CR1.3**: Set up environment variables for production

### 2. Redis Configuration
- **CR2.1**: Configure Redis client with connection pooling
- **CR2.2**: Set appropriate timeout values
- **CR2.3**: Implement reconnection logic

### 3. Template Alignment
- **CR3.1**: Compare Cloudflare Workers template with Vercel React Router template
- **CR3.2**: Adopt Vercel-specific optimizations and best practices
- **CR3.3**: Remove Cloudflare-specific configuration files

## Migration Constraints

### 1. Zero Downtime
- **MC1.1**: Migration should be testable without affecting current production
- **MC1.2**: Ability to rollback if issues are discovered

### 2. Data Migration
- **MC2.1**: Existing cache data does not need to be migrated (can start fresh)
- **MC2.2**: Document any data that might be lost during migration

### 3. Cost Considerations
- **MC3.1**: Stay within Vercel's free tier limits (100K function invocations/month)
- **MC3.2**: Consider Redis free tier limitations

## Success Criteria

1. Application successfully deploys to Vercel with fixed region
2. All translation functionality works as expected
3. Redis caching reduces API calls and improves response times
4. No OpenAI API blocking issues due to region
5. All tests pass in the new environment
6. Clean removal of all Cloudflare-specific code
